There are all kinds of brainteasers that test our perception and swiftness of mind. The latest? A game created by UK-based lens retailer Lenstore that tests what's called the Stroop effect.

The Stroop Effect is a well-known psychological phenomenon that challenges how we name physical colours when they are used to spell the name of a different colour.

"For example," it says, "if the word 'red' is printed in yellow ink it will take a different amount of time for a person to name the color of the ink than if the word 'red' is printed in red ink."

The game flashes the name of a color and asks players to write the name of the color they're actually seeing.
