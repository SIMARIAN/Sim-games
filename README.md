<h4>ABOUT GUESS THE COLOUR GAME:</h4>
<p>Based on Stroop effect. The Stroop Effect is a well-known psychological phenomenon that challenges how we name physical colours when they are used to spell the name of a different colour.
"For example," it says, "if the word 'red' is printed in yellow ink it will take a different amount of time for a person to name the color of the ink than if the word 'red' is printed in red ink." The game flashes the name of a color and asks players to write the name of the color they're actually seeing.</p>
